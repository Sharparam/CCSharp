Installation
------------

Get the [latest stable build](http://ci.sharparam.com/job/CCSharp/lastStableBuild/) and download the ZIP file to your mods folder (usually %AppData%\.minecraft\mods).

Requirements
------------

CCSharp is built against [Minecraft Forge](http://www.minecraftforge.net/) and requires that to be installed in order to load and run.

CCSharp adds features to [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/), and thus requires that to be installed as well.
